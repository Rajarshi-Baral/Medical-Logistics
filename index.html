        <p class="txtSml">
            Metformin is a commonly prescribed oral medication used to manage type 2 diabetes. It helps lower blood sugar levels by improving the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin and reducing glucose production by the liver. Metformin is often the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and may be used alone or in combination with other medications. It is usually taken with meals to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea. In addition to its role in blood sugar control, metformin has been studied for its potential benefits in weight management and cardiovascular health.

Azithromycin is often taken once daily for a few days, and its long half-life allows for a shorter course of treatment compared to other antibiotics. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. It's important to complete the full course of azithromycin as prescribed to prevent antibiotic resistance.
