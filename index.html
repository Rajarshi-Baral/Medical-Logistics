                    Medicine is the science and practice of caring for patients, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.</p>

            1. Metformin
        </p>
        <p class="txtSml">
            Metformin is a commonly prescribed oral medication used to manage type 2 diabetes. It helps lower blood sugar levels by improving the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin and reducing glucose production by the liver. Metformin is often the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and may be used alone or in combination with other medications. It is usually taken with meals to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea. In addition to its role in blood sugar control, metformin has been studied for its potential benefits in weight management and cardiovascular health.

        <p class="txtSml">
            Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and certain types of chest pain (angina). It works by relaxing the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily, which helps lower blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart. Amlodipine is typically taken once daily, with or without food. Common side effects may include swelling of the ankles or feet, dizziness, and fatigue. Amlodipine is often prescribed as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise.

        <p class="txtSml">
            Atorvastatin is a statin medication used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol. By inhibiting an enzyme involved in cholesterol production, atorvastatin helps reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions. It is usually taken once daily, with or without food. Common side effects include muscle pain, fatigue, and digestive issues. In rare cases, atorvastatin can cause more serious side effects, such as liver damage or a severe muscle condition called rhabdomyolysis.

        <p class="txtSml">
            Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a widely used over-the-counter medication for pain relief and fever reduction. It works by inhibiting the production of certain chemicals in the brain that cause pain and fever. Paracetamol is often used to treat mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, muscle aches, and toothaches, as well as to reduce fever. It is generally considered safe when used as directed, but overdose can lead to serious liver damage. Paracetamol is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and liquid.

        </p>
        <p class="txtSml">
            Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach. It is commonly prescribed for conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), stomach ulcers, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. By decreasing stomach acid, omeprazole helps relieve symptoms like heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and persistent cough. It is usually taken once daily, before meals. Common side effects include headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Long-term use of omeprazole may be associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, vitamin B12 deficiency, and kidney problems.

            Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including respiratory infections, skin infections, ear infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. It works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria, helping the body's immune system fight off the infection. Azithromycin is often taken once daily for a few days, and its long half-life allows for a shorter course of treatment compared to other antibiotics. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. It's important to complete the full course of azithromycin as prescribed to prevent antibiotic resistance.
